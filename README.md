## Problem Domain

To prepare for the final project and learn how to use **React Native** I am building an app that uses the chat features from our _Youth Connect_ Backend API to build a very basic preview of what the youth connect app may look like.

### Collaborators: Code Fellows Lab 43

**Lab/Coding Session #1** - Focus on getting your dev system up and operational, getting "proof of life" and reaching your MVP in terms of baseline functionality

**Lab/Coding Session #2** - Add in the device features, polish, and prepare for deployments.

### Requirements

- Use at least 1 native device feature (Contacts, Camera, GPS, etc)
- High Fidelity Styling and UX
- Properly Documented for End Users
- Live Demo & Presentation

- Use 2 screens / components
- Use and share state between components/screens

### Milestone 1 - MVP

- Deliver your MVP for raw functionality
- Your dev environment should be properly working
- Other users should be able to scan your QR and see your app on any device
- All of your core "features" should be working properly

### Milestone 2 - Product Delivery (This Lab)

As you complete your RNA, switch your focus to the user experience.

- Quality and Thoughtful Styling using `css-in-js`
- Right sized tap targets, good contrast
- Dark and Light Modes
- Well thought through UX

### How to use locally?
